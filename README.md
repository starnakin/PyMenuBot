# PyMenuBot
This is my first project to be maintained for a few months! 😁

## The concept
I need a shared shopping list with all member of my family, and I hate the front end so I have made a discord bot to have It.
This bot have some good feature like :
  * Price estamation of the price of all item's in the shopping list
  * Orthographe tolerance (banana and bananas are merged in one item)
  * Be updated all time (I use It since few month so if have an idea I add It)

## If you have some bugs or any idea make an issue
